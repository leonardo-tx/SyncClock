# SyncClock
[![.NET](https://github.com/leonardo-tx/SyncClock/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/leonardo-tx/SyncClock/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

SyncClock is a console application for Windows that automatically synchronizes 
the computer's time.

## Why did you create this program?
My Windows for some reason doesn't sync the time automatically, so I decided to do 
something that would do that.

## How to use?
You just need to run the program as an administrator and it will start working.

The program needs to be open for auto sync to work.
